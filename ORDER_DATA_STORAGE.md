# Order Data Storage in MongoDB

## âœ… What Gets Stored When Customer Places Order

When a customer places an order, the following data is **captured as a snapshot** and stored in MongoDB:

### ðŸ“¦ Product Snapshot Fields (per product in order):

```javascript
{
  product: ObjectId("..."),        // Reference to product
  quantity: 104,                   // Exact quantity ordered
  price: 3.00,                     // Unit price (backward compatibility)
  
  // SNAPSHOT DATA (Added after migration):
  unitPrice: 3.00,                 // Price per unit at order time
  netAmount: 312.00,               // unitPrice Ã— quantity (before tax)
  taxAmount: 0.00,                 // GST amount
  totalAmount: 312.00,             // netAmount + taxAmount
  gst: 0,                          // GST percentage (0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28%)
  productName: "Km 809 A Trimmer CHARGEABLE HOT SELLING",
  productImage: "https://...",     // Product image URL
  unitSet: 2                       // Unit set (packaging size)
}
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Points:

1. **Price Frozen at Order Time**
   - When customer adds to cart and checks out, the price at that moment is captured
   - If bulk pricing applies (e.g., buy 100+ get â‚¹3.00/unit), that discounted price is stored
   - Price in order will NEVER change even if product price is updated later

2. **Quantity & Unit Set**
   - Exact quantity customer ordered is stored
   - Unit set (packaging) is also stored as snapshot
   - Example: If unitSet=5 and customer orders 100, both values are saved

3. **Tax Calculation Snapshot**
   - GST percentage at order time is saved
   - Tax amount is pre-calculated and stored
   - Even if GST rates change later, order shows original tax

4. **Product Details Snapshot**
   - Product name is saved (so admin can see it even if product is deleted)
   - Product image URL is saved
   - These remain visible in admin panel even if product no longer exists

## ðŸ“Š Example Order Document:

```json
{
  "_id": "68d0e685bbf2fe48695fd6a8",
  "products": [
    {
      "product": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      "quantity": 104,
      "price": 3.00,
      "unitPrice": 3.00,
      "netAmount": 312.00,
      "taxAmount": 0.00,
      "totalAmount": 312.00,
      "gst": 0,
      "productName": "Km 809 A Trimmer CHARGEABLE HOT SELLING",
      "productImage": "https://ik.imagekit.io/...",
      "unitSet": 2
    },
    {
      "product": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439012",
      "quantity": 180,
      "price": 160.00,
      "unitPrice": 160.00,
      "netAmount": 28800.00,
      "taxAmount": 0.00,
      "totalAmount": 28800.00,
      "gst": 0,
      "productName": "Zengaa Puzzule Game",
      "productImage": "https://ik.imagekit.io/...",
      "unitSet": 3
    }
  ],
  "buyer": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439013",
  "amount": 29112.00,
  "deliveryCharges": 0,
  "codCharges": 0,
  "discount": 0,
  "status": "Pending",
  "payment": {
    "paymentMethod": "COD",

}
```

## ðŸ”„ Order Update Flow:

### When Customer Places Order:
1. Cart items are sent to backend
2. `enrichOrderProducts()` fetches current product details
3. Calculates bulk pricing if applicable
4. Creates snapshot with all fields
5. Saves to MongoDB

### When Admin Edits Order:
1. Admin can change unit price manually
2. Admin can change quantity
3. Snapshot fields are recalculated automatically:
   - `netAmount = unitPrice Ã— quantity`
   - `taxAmount = netAmount Ã— (gst / 100)`
   - `totalAmount = netAmount + taxAmount`
4. Changes saved to MongoDB

## âœ… Benefits:

1. **Price Integrity** - Customer pays what they saw at checkout
2. **Historical Accuracy** - Orders show exact details from order time
3. **Audit Trail** - Complete record of what was sold at what price
4. **Admin Flexibility** - Can still manually adjust if needed
5. **Deleted Products** - Orders visible even if product deleted

## ðŸ“Œ Schema Location:

- **Model**: `/models/orderModel.js`
- **Helper**: `/helpers/orderSnapshotHelper.js`
- **Order Creation**: `/controllers/productController.js` (lines 1204, 1540)

## ðŸŽ‰ Result:

Your orders now have complete, accurate snapshot data that never changes unless manually edited by admin!
